<h2>About Us</h2>

<h3><img src="images/aboutus.png" width="496" height="370" alt="About Us" /></h3>

<p>My name is Olga, and I am originally from Russia.  I studied seamstress work after high school in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>At that time the Soviet Union produced a lot of cloth, as factories had production quotas.  But the clothes were very boring!  I worked for a boutique that smuggled interesting dress patterns from London, Paris, and New York.  We then made elegant dresses for clients from the surplus cloth.  This was a high volume, full time, dressmaking job.</p>

<p>As I honed my skills, I had the confidence to go freelance.  During the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was not much work or even food.  But I acquiredthe basic necessities from my freelance dressmaking.</p>

<p>As Russia recovered, I gained my Bachelors and Masters Degrees, but still kept freelancing in the evening making and altering clothes.  The freelancing bought me an apartment!</p>

<p>Then, as the best piece of good luck, I met David, while he was in Russia, learning the language.  After a while, we married, moved to Phoenix, and I learned English.  I became a US Citizen.  I love the warm weather after the cold of Russia, and being married is very special after a lot of years alone.</p>

<p>I started again with my freelance work, and I welcome your alterations, dresses, cushions, curtains, and special projects.</p>
